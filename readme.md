## Procedure

* atmega328 is interfaced with Ultrasonic sensor .
* An ultrasonic sensor is an instrument that measures the distance to an object using ultrasonic sound waves.
* Then it gives the signal to t microcontroller.
* Then the microcntroller displays the measured output via the display.

## For Testing and using code

* For simulation purposes use simulide .
* To run the code use codeblocks.
* In Code Blocks you can also RUN the program in both LINUX and WINDOWS.
